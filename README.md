# Mind-tutorial
Mind+ is a visual programming software that enables anyone to make fast prototypes intuitively and enjoy hardware hacking even without programming background. Just drag and drop modules, set up parameters and connect modules after building the circuit. Then your DIY project is good to go!

1. Install the software (available on WIN7/WIN8/XP)

2. Read the general guideline to get familiar with creating blocks, drawing connection/lines and uploading for your code.

3. Project List are all available from the tutorial file.We use Arduino UNO in the kit. If you need to get the kit including the board and parts, you can find it on [Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mind-Beginner-Kit-Programming-Language/dp/B01EY5IMEM) and [Famosa Studio(Indonesia)](http://www.famosastudio.com/mind-plus-diy-kit-for-beginners).
